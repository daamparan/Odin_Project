# Odin_Project


## Welcome / Overview

Hello, this repo has the simple purpose of holding all the material in relation to the 
Odin Project. In short, the Odin Project is a learning resource that helps you delve in the world of Web Development with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I will try instructions or at least some directions as to what file represents what. Instead of creating various repos I will keep everything under one but with different folders that may or may not share code. Any kind of charing, hierachy, relation etc will be disclosed in the README.md or in the file
