# Working with Text

## Overview
This section will primarily cover dealing with text. This will include but is not limited to
using and creating: 
* Paragraphs 
* Headings
* Bold text
* Italicized
* Relationship between nested elements
* HTML elements

### Details and Important remarks
* Using certain elements will affect accessibility tools differently. For example, using <h1> will mark the 
given heading as the first item in the hierarchy. From there items can be wrapped in this given <h1>, with that being said
all these items should be put in the correct hierarchy levels for accessibility reasons. 
* HTML Elements have parent-child relationships, these are represented by the indentations that are found along the HTML file.
