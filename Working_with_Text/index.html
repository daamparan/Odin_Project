        After the success of God of War 2018 nobody thought the hype and value of the game would 
        be the same as it once was. Little did we know what Santa Monica and new director would bring us. 
        One of the best action adventure rpg games of the year. 
        In my opinion making a very strong case for game of the year, although it did lose the award to Elden Ring.
